# l-flexbox

l-flexbox.css is a CSS utility class to help you quickly build complex
layouts using flexbox.

l-flexbox.css supports a `float` fallback for browsers that don't support
the flexbox spec.

## What does it do?

* Allows you to quickly start using CSS3 flexbox for layouts.
* Gives you sensible default fallback support in older browsers.
* Encourages (but does not enforce) [BEM-style CSS](http://bem.info/method/) conventions.
* Provides easy hooks for extensibility.
* Explains what the code does using detailed comments.
